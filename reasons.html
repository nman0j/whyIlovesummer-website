<h1><u>Reasons Why I Love Summer!</u><h1>
</font>
<font face="Arial" color="#000" size="4.5">
<p>After harsh winters, when school is coming to an end summer arrives. I love summer because schools give a long break for it. I enjoy how the harsh winter weather disappears into a warm sunny summer. I get to wear shorts, summer dresses, and other casual clothes. I also to see my friends more often. All my favorite fruits are available during the summer, especially watermelons. Summer means I can go swimming in the pool! Which I enjoy with my siblings and friends. Aside from the exciting vacations; during the summer the sun is out longer, so I have more time to do all the fun outdoor activities planned.</p>
